# ztunnel — L4 node proxy (Rust DaemonSet)
# Chart: istio/ztunnel v1.28.3
#
# Provides:
#   - Automatic mTLS between all ambient-enrolled pods
#   - SPIFFE identity (one per service account)
#   - Connection-level authorization policies
#   - HBONE tunneling to waypoint proxies
#
# Runs on every node. When a namespace is labeled with
# istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient, ztunnel transparently captures
# all traffic from pods in that namespace.
#
# Must tolerate ALL node taints to run on every node in the cluster
# (platform, gateway, and agents node groups).

tolerations:
  - key: workload
    operator: Exists
